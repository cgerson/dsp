# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

What does `ls` do? What do `ls -a`, `ls -l`, and `ls -lh` do? What combinations of those flags are meaningful?

'ls' lists the files in the current directory. The '-a' flag makes sure to include all files, even if they are hidden. The '-l' flag shows files in long-list format (printing more information on the file such as permissions to read/write/execute, number of links, owner, modified date, etc, as opposed to just the file names). The '-lh' flag prints the same info as '-l', but prints the size of the file in human readable format (3.2K instead of 3200). To print details about all files in long-list form and with human-readable sizes, including hidden files, you can combine flags: 'ls -a -lh'.
